### Ice Cream Profits Prediction

# Overview

This repository contains a small machine learning project focused on predicting ice cream profits. The goal of this project is to develop a simple predictive model that estimates the profits of an ice cream stand based on temperature.

The dataset is from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raphaelmanayon/temperature-and-ice-cream-sales/data).
